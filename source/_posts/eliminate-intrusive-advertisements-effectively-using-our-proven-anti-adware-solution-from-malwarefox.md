Adware is an advertisement based software. Once installed, it starts showing ads in different forms like pop-up window or browser toolbar. Though annoying, but most of the adware are safe in nature. However, some adware might be engineered for wrong purposes like tracking browsing behavior, [recording keystrokes](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) or even hiding malware. They are categorised into [potentially unwanted programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) (PUPs)

Software developers integrate ads or bundle another software into their programs to [support development cost](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). However, some developers might use it to spread spam and encourage malicious activities.

You often fall for these wordings or donâ€™t care about what may come in. This is how adware sneaks into your computer system.
