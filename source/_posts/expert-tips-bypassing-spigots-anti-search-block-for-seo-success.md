## What is “Search Protection”?

Search Protection is a potentially unwanted program(PUP) by Spigot Inc that pretends to help you in improving your online search results. However, in reality, it is a browser hijacker that takes control of your browser and change the default search engine, the home page, new tab redirect, and more. Search Protection redirects the user to search.yahoo.com. Search Protection is designed to protect its bundled programs and ensure that they remain installed on the system without any changes.

When the user tries to revert the settings, they get the following error message:

_Search Settings Change Notification_
_**Search Protection** has blocked an attempt by another program_ 
_to change your default search settings._

The Search Protection program interferes with online searches and other processes involving browsing online. When it is installed on your system, the SearchProtection.exe process would be running in the background. You can check that in the Windows Task Manager. Search Protection focuses on redirecting the user to affiliated pages and commercial content because such websites can generate revenue for the publisher. Browser hijacker changes various settings and preferences on web browsers so it can control where the user is redirected.

## What are the symptoms of “Search Protection” Infiltration?

Since it is a PUP, generally, the Search Protection browser hijacker application is not manually installed by users into their system. It usually infiltrates the device through the bundled program, infected sites, drive-by download, and more. 

When your system gets infected by it, it will show the following signs:

* Default search engine, the home page, new tab redirection would change to search.yahoo.com.
* While browsing, you will be redirected to irrelevant and untrustworthy websites.
* You see a lot of advertisements while browsing the internet.
* The system becomes slow and sluggish.
* Since SearchProtection.exe keeps running in the background, it would increase the RAM usage.
* CPU gets heated because of the continuous running of the application.

## How to remove “Search Protection”?

It is essential to remove the Search Protection from the system as it may cause havoc. The browser hijackers may cause ad bombardment, release malware, and perform other more malicious tasks to slow down your system.

Here are the steps to eradicate it from the system.

### **Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve the critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and its files that try to run automatically on your system.

### **Remove Web Extensions From Browser**

You might have accidentally installed a malicious browser web extension that is responsible for Search Protection download.

If you have many web extensions installed in your Chrome browser, it is time to sort them out and at least disable, if not delete, the ones you rarely use. However, you must remove the useless web extensions instead of disabling them. Because, even after disabling them, they might use the CPU processing power while checking for updates and performing updates.

Here are the steps to manage the web extensions on the Chrome Browser:

1. Click on the three dots at the top-right corner.
2. Bring mouse cursor over **More tools** and from the extended menu choose **Extensions**.![Extensions settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Extensions-settings.png)
3. All the extensions would be on your screen
4. Look for the ones you want to disable or remove.![manage chrome extensions](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/manage-chrome-extensions.jpg)
